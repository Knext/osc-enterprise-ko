It offers a template for the Approval Request Form used by developers to request approval to use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in a commercial product.

**Generic FOSS Policy**<br>
Companies using FOSS often create a company-wide policy to ensure that all staff is informed of how to use FOSS (especially in products), to maximize the impact and benefit of using FOSS, and to ensure that any technical, legal, or business risks resulting from that usage are properly mitigated. This document is a free resource available from the Linux Foundation under the Open Compliance Program. It offers a generic FOSS policy that companies can use as starting point in creating their own FOSS policy. It provides a template policy that focuses on governing FOSS usage in externally distributed products and that can be customized to the company’s specific needs.<br>
